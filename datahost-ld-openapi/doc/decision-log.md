# Data Host Decision Log

This document is a running log of decisions/conclusions we've come to in meetings as a group. It will change over time but serves as a reference point for all developers at a given point in time as the design of the datahost API evolves.

**Re: Order of appends/deletes/corrections**
- We will not worry about how appends and deletes intersect for now. We'll enforce a consistent order for every revision and if users append and delete a row in the same revision those rows will effectively just be ignored.

**Re: Basic auth**
- The point right now is just to prevent random users and bots on the internet from discovering the write API and adding data. We do not need proper auth at the moment.
- A single user/pass is fine for now. The only user will be Rob and possibly someone at ONS who we will know.
- We're undecided for now whether the app or a proxy is the right place to implement the basic auth. Decision is pending another decision about which proxy we will use ([issue #167 here](https://github.com/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes/issues/167)**

**Re: Update model**
The latest agreements about the entity/update model are these:
- There is only one append per revision right now, eventually we will support one delete and one correction as well
- Users can request a CSV from a release, which will get the complete latest revision -- the release download is effectively a pointer to the latest revision
- Every revision has a download, which is the sum of all revisions to that point
- Users can request the contents of the appends/deletes/corrections separately

**Re: JSON vs JSON-ld**
- Right now we'll treat the write API as a JSON API, and not require or accept contexts because there is only one correct context anyway and we know what it is. In the future we may want to allow users to supply JSON-LD but we can handle this via content negotiation and not mix JSON and JSON-LD endpoints, because validating arbitrary JSON as RDF opens some questions that we havenâ€™t answered yet, like exactly what schema to validate the JSON-LD against and what prefixes and base URLs to accept.

**Re: Fuseki**
- We'll stick with the RDF4J native store mounted on its own volume as the triplestore for now
- We realized fuseki/JENA likely won't be the correct solution for the full production system anyway, and the RDF4J native store can meet our needs for this phase, so there is no point in adding more complexity to our deployment and development by adding a separate db right now

**Re: Using SQL for dataset storage**
- Tablecloth provides an in-memory data structures are convenient but are obviously limit the size of the ingested data.
- We used generated data (see [issue #314](https://github.com/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes/issues/314)) to import up to 10mil rows
  using H2 and SQLite databases in a spike (TC couldn't go beyond 3mil on M2 MB Pro with 16GB RAM).

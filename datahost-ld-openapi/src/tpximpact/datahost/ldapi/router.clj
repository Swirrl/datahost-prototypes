(def ^:private api-description
  "Datahost is a prototype service aiming to simplify the publication
and consumption of statistical datasets on the web, whilst following
Linked Data Principles, best practices and web standards, without
assuming detailed knowledge of them.

It has been developed by TPXImpact in partnership with the Office of
National Statistics.

More details of the project can be found on the projects [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Swirrl/datahost-prototypes/tree/main/datahost-ld-openapi).

Datahost's API is broadly divided to support two distinct audiences:

1. Data users and consumers via the [Consumer API](#/Consumer%20API).
2. Data publishers, who use both the [Publisher API](#/Publisher%20API) and [Consumer API](#/Consumer%20API).

# Data Model

## Overview

Datahost aims to give improved guarantees to data consumers, by
requiring publishers make commitments to consumers about the
management and shape of the data. These commitments govern how the
data will be managed over time, and come in the form of a versioning
model enforced by Datahost and dataset schemas.

With datahost publishers are encouraged to declare their datasets
schema in advance by associating releases of their dataset with a
schema. Datahost ensures that all revisions of a dataset/release must
then conform to that releases declared schema.

To understand the Datahost data model, we first need to understand
some datahost terminology:

- Dataset-Series - In Datahost a dataset-series is a name and global
  identifier representing a dataset over its whole lifetime. It can
  cover all historic and future releases of that Dataset. A good
  example would be \"[The Census](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census)\",
  which has been assembled every ten years since 1801. Throughout this
  time the methodology and shape/schema of the data has changed many
  times, but its purpose to measure the population has remained. -

- Release - In Datahost a release is how we identify a dataset with a
  specific schema and methodology. Releases may be updated over time,
  but they make the commitment to consumers that any changes to them
  will be explicitly captured in change logs, and that all such
  revisions will conform to the schema for the release.

  This allows publishers to make improvements to a release after
  publication, for example correcting mistakes in the figures whilst
  providing transparency to consumers that changes were made, and that
  those changes will always be compatible with the releases published
  schema.

  A release has a name e.g. \"2021\" which when combined with the
  dataset-series name forms the full name of the dataset release e.g.
  \"The Census 2021\". Users will usually want the latest revision of
  a release, and knowing the combined series and release name will let
  them do that.

- Schema - In Datahost we define a simple schema language which is a
  valid subset of CSVW, but introduces a few extra properties to help
  support versioning. We surface these schemas as datahost/CSVW
  schemas to consumers.

- Revision - In Datahost a revision represents a named published set
  of changes to a dataset release. All changes within a revision
  *MUST* conform to the Release's pre-published schema. Revisions
  contain a sequence of changes or commits.

- Change/Commit - In Datahost there are 3 types of change that can occur.

  - Appends - Represent the addition of more data to a release. Adding
    more data providing it conforms to the pre-published schema should
    never be a breaking change to consumers. Datahost will enforce
    this guarantee.

  - Retractions - We don't encourage publishers removing data from
    releases, however from time to time there is a need for publishers
    to do it. Datahost will support publishers in removing the
    information as a soft-delete, which retains the previous revision
    containing the deletion and also a retraction commit stating
    explicitly what data was removed. This is useful information for
    consumers, and provides a method to safely stay up to date.

  - Corrections - Are a special composite form of a retraction and an
    append that represent an amended figure in the data. In addition
    corrections contain a backlink to the previous figure, allowing
    users and publishers an easy way to explore figure changes.

  All commits contain a message in the form of a description.

## Data and Metadata

The Datahost data model follows linked data principles and web best
practices to ensure as much as possible a resource oriented approach
to our API.

In particular resource's may contain many representations, and those
representations may partially represent that entity.

Broadly speaking Datahost assumes that when we're speaking about the
data behind a resource we will refer it to with a mimetype of
`text/csv`, whilst if we're speaking about the metadata we'll refer to
it as `application/json` (or `application/ld+json`). Typically this is
done by setting the `Accept` and `Content-Type` HTTP headers as
appropriate.

For example a revision to a dataset-series's release is represented by it's URI e.g.

`/data/census/releases/2021/revisions/1`

If we want to know what all the data in this revision looks like, we
can request it by setting the `Accept` header to `text/csv`, which
will return all the data in that revision. However if we want to know
what metadata there is about that revision, we will request it by
setting the `Accept` header to `application/json`.

In Datahost it's possible for some resources to only have metadata or
data representations available. This should be documented in the API
specifications for each route.")

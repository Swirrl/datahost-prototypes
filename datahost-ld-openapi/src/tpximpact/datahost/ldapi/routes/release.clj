(defn get-release-route-config [triplestore change-store system-uris]
  {:summary "Retrieve metadata for an existing release"
   :description "Given a dataset-series slug and a release slug,
return data or metadata associated with a release.

The data associated with the latest release and revision can obtained
by issuing a request with an `Accept` header of `text/csv`, this will
result in a redirection to the latest revision of the data.

The metadata associated with the release can be obtained by issuing a
request with an `Accept` header of `application/ld+json`, which will
return a JSON/LD metadata document describing the release resource.

Releases themselves do not contain data, and instead defer to
revisions to describe the data at a particular point in time. This
means that all releases that contain any data MUST have at least one
revision containing at least one change/commit.

To load a release with data you must first create a revision with
it (representing the identifier for the next update), then within that
revision you create any number of changes/commits.

e.g. looking at the following diagram:

- My Release
  - Revision 1
    - Commit 1 (append 100 Rows)
  - Revision 2
    - Commit 1 (delete 1 Row)
    - Commit 2 (append 100 Rows)
    - Commit 3 (correct 2 Rows)

We can see that the Revision 1 contains the first commit of data to
the dataset.

Revision 2 however follows Revision 1, and it contains 3 further
commits (R2.1 R2.2 & R2.3), but it also follows R1.1, so the state of
the Revision when materialised contains the data supplied in
R1.1, less the delete made in R2.1.

It is currently considered an error to put data into a revision which
has been succeeded by another.
